## :clipboard: Explanation

The `epur_str` program takes a string as an argument and displays the string with exactly one space between words, removing any extra spaces or tabs at the beginning or the end. Here's a brief overview of the implementation:

1. The program first checks if the number of arguments is 1 (i.e., one argument provided).
2. If the number of arguments is not 1, or if there are no words to display, it writes a newline character '\n' to the standard output using the `write` function and exits the program.
3. If the argument is provided, it assigns it to the `str` variable.
4. The program then iterates over the characters in the string.
5. It skips any leading spaces or tabs by incrementing the index `i` until a non-space/tab character is found.
6. If `flag` is set (indicating that a word has already been written), it writes a single space character ' ' to the standard output using the `write` function.
7. It then iterates over the characters until it reaches the end of the string or encounters a space/tab character.
8. Inside the loop, it writes each character of the word to the standard output using the `write` function.
9. After writing a word, it increments `i` to move to the next word or to skip any consecutive spaces/tabs.
10. Finally, it writes a newline character '\n' to the standard output using the `write` function.

The program utilizes the `write` function for outputting characters and handles space/tab removal and word separation based on the given logic.

Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string, and displays this string with exactly one
space between words, with no spaces or tabs either at the beginning or the end,
followed by a \n.

A "word" is defined as a part of a string delimited either by spaces/tabs, or
by the start/end of the string.

If the number of arguments is not 1, or if there are no words to display, the
program displays \n.

Example:

$> ./epur_str "See? It's easy to print the same thing" | cat -e
See? It's easy to print the same thing$
$> ./epur_str " this        time it      will     be    more complex  . " | cat -e
this time it will be more complex .$
$> ./epur_str "No S*** Sherlock..." "nAw S*** ShErLaWQ..." | cat -e
$
$> ./epur_str "" | cat -e
$
$>

$> ./epur_str "vous voyez c'est facile d'afficher la meme chose" | cat -e
vous voyez c'est facile d'afficher la meme chose$
$> ./epur_str " seulement          la c'est      plus dur " | cat -e
seulement la c'est plus dur$
$> ./epur_str "comme c'est cocasse" "vous avez entendu, Mathilde ?" | cat -e
$
$> ./epur_str "" | cat -e
$
$>
