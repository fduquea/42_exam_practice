## :clipboard: Explanation

The `ft_swap` function is designed to swap the contents of two integers. Here's a brief overview of the implementation:

1. The function `ft_swap` is defined with two parameters, `int *a` and `int *b`, representing the addresses of the integers to be swapped.
2. Inside the function, a temporary integer variable `temp` is declared.
3. The value at address `a` is stored in `temp` to preserve it.
4. The value at address `b` is then assigned to address `a`, effectively swapping the contents of the two integers.
5. Finally, the value stored in `temp` is assigned to address `b`, completing the swap.
