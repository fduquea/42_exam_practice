## Explanation

Simple, if the current character is in the first half of the alphabet, move up 13 positions in the ascii table and print it, if it's in the second half of the alphabet, moove down 13 positions in the ascii table and print it.

## Subject

```
Assignment name  : rot_13
Expected files   : rot_13.c
Allowed functions: write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes a string and displays it, replacing each of its
letters by the letter 13 spaces ahead in alphabetical order.

'z' becomes 'm' and 'Z' becomes 'M'. Case remains unaffected.

The output will be followed by a newline.

If the number of arguments is not 1, the program displays a newline.

Example:

$>./rot_13 "abc"
nop
$>./rot_13 "My horse is Amazing." | cat -e
Zl ubefr vf Nznmvat.$
$>./rot_13 "AkjhZ zLKIJz , 23y " | cat -e
NxwuM mYXVWm , 23l $
$>./rot_13 | cat -e
$
$>
$>./rot_13 "" | cat -e
$
$>
