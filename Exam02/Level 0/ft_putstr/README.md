## Explanation

The `ft_putstr` function is designed to display a string on the standard output. Here's a brief overview of the implementation:

1. The program includes the necessary header file `<unistd.h>` for the `write` function.
2. The function `ft_putstr` is defined with a parameter `char *str`.
3. Inside the function, an integer variable `i` is initialized to 0.
4. The function enters a loop that continues until the end of the string is reached (indicated by the null character `'\0'`).
5. Inside the loop, the function uses the `write` function to write the character at the current index `i` of the string `str` to the standard output.
6. The function increments `i` to move to the next character in the string.
7. The loop continues until the end of the string is reached.
8. The function completes its execution.

The allowed function `write` is used to output characters.
