## Explanation

The `is_power_of_2` function is designed to determine whether a given number is a power of 2. It returns 1 if the number is a power of 2 and 0 otherwise.

Here is an overview of the implementation:

1. The function takes an unsigned integer `n` as input.
2. It enters a loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. Within the loop, it checks if `n` is equal to 2. If it is, the function returns 1, indicating that it is a power of 2.
4. If `n` is not equal to 2, it checks if `n` is divisible by 2 without any remainder. If it is not divisible by 2, the function returns 0, indicating that it is not a power of 2.
5. If `n` is divisible by 2, it updates `n` by dividing it by 2.
6. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0 or a condition for returning 1 or 0 is met.
7. If the loop completes without returning, the function returns 0 to indicate that the given number is not a power of 2.
