## Explanation

Since the subject allows the use of atoi, it's easy, make the first and third argument an int, and then create if's to check the second argument character, when you know what the second argument character is, you know what operation you need to do.
Print the result of the operation after.

## Subject

```
Assignment name  : do_op
Expected files   : do_op.c
Allowed functions: atoi, printf, write
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes three strings:
- The first and the third one are representations of base-10 signed integers
  that fit in an int.
- The second one is an arithmetic operator chosen from: + - * / %

The program must display the result of the requested arithmetic operation,
followed by a newline. If the number of parameters is not 3, the program
just displays a newline.

You can assume the string have no mistakes or extraneous characters. Negative
numbers, in input or output, will have one and only one leading '-'. The
result of the operation fits in an int.

Examples:

$> ./do_op "123" "*" 456 | cat -e
56088$
$> ./do_op "9828" "/" 234 | cat -e
42$
$> ./do_op "1" "+" "-43" | cat -e
-42$
$> ./do_op | cat -e
$
