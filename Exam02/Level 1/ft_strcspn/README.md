## Explanation

The function receives a string with the characters we need to check and another string with the characters we want to compare to the first one.
Compare each character of 's' to the characters of 'reject' and return the position where the character of 's' is rejected, if there are no rejected characters, return the number of characters that there are on 's', basically its length.
